1,https://www.beelinereader.com,History,No Copyright,"John Fitzgerald Kennedy was born in Brookline, Massachusetts on May 29, 1917. He was the second son of Joseph P. Kennedy, Sr., and Rose Fitzgerald. Rose was the eldest child of John Fitzgerald, a prominent Boston political figure who was the city's mayor and a three-term member of Congress. Kennedy's ancestry was predominantly Irish, and all eight of his great-grandparents had immigrated from Ireland. Kennedy lived in Brookline for ten years. In 1927, the family moved to New York City.","In the summertime, Kennedy and his family visited their home in Hyannisport, Massachusetts. At Christmas and Easter holidays they went to their winter home in Palm Beach, Florida. In September 1931, Kennedy was sent to The Choate School in Wallingford, Connecticut, for high school. His older brother, Joe Jr., had already been at Choate for two years.","Kennedy spent his first years at Choate in his brother's shadow, and compensated for this with rebellious behavior. On one occasion, he and his friends exploded a toilet seat with a powerful firecracker. In the ensuing chapel assembly, the strict headmaster, George St. John, brandished the toilet seat and spoke of certain ""muckers"" who would ""spit in our sea."" The defiant Kennedy took the cue and named his group ""The Muckers Club."" Kennedy graduated from Choate in June 1935. For the school yearbook, of which he had been business manager, Kennedy was voted the ""most likely to succeed.""","In September 1936, Kennedy enrolled at Harvard College, where he tried out for the football, golf, and swim teams and earned a spot on the varsity swim team. At Harvard, Kennedy also developed an interest in political philosophy. He graduated with a degree in International Affairs. Many years later, he went on to become the 35th president of the United States.",JFK and his friends exploded a,Toilet seat,Bathtub,Armoire,Toilet seat,JFK's grandparents were all:,German,Irish,Swiss,Irish,JFK's classmates voted him:,Most likely to succeed,Best hair,Most likely to fail,Most likely to succeed
2,https://www.beelinereader.com,Nature,No Copyright,"Dolphins are social and live in groups known as ""pods."" Pods can contain up to a dozen dolphins. In places with an abundance of food, pods can merge temporarily, forming a ""superpod."" Such groupings may exceed 1,000 dolphins. Dolphins communicate using a variety of clicks and whistle-like sounds. Membership in pods is not rigid. However, dolphins can establish strong social bonds. For example, they will stay with injured or ill dolphins, even helping them to breathe by bringing them to the surface if needed.","This altruism does not appear to be limited to their own species. A dolphin in New Zealand has been observed guiding a female Pygmy Sperm Whale together with her calf out of shallow water where they had stranded several times. They have also been seen protecting swimmers from sharks by swimming circles around the swimmers or charging the sharks to make them go away. Dolphins also display culture, something long believed to be unique to humans, and possibly other primate species.","In May 2005, a discovery in Australia found bottlenose dolphins teaching their young to use tools. They cover their snouts with sponges to protect them while foraging. This knowledge is mostly transferred by mothers to daughters, unlike primates, where knowledge is generally passed on to both sexes. Using sponges as mouth protection is a learned behavior. Another learned behavior was discovered among river dolphins in Brazil, where some male dolphins use weeds and sticks as part of a mating display.","Dolphins also engage in acts of aggression towards each other. The older a male dolphin is, the more likely his body is to be covered with bite scars. Male dolphins engage in such acts of aggression apparently for the same reasons as humans: disputes between companions and competition for females. Acts of aggression can become so intense that targeted dolphins sometimes go into exile as a result of losing a fight.",What is the name of a group of dolphins?,"a ""school""","a ""pod""","a ""herd""","a ""pod""",Do dolphins pass cultural knowledge to their offspring?,yes,no,sometimes,yes,Do dolphins ever fight with each other?,"Yes, only males","No, always","Yes, sometimes","Yes, sometimes"

The first thing she did to get ready was to eat a healthy breakfast. Her favorite breakfast was toast, fruit, and yogurt. It tasted great, and it kept her feeling energized all through the morning. After breakfast, Olivia put on her tennis outfit and tennis shoes. She tied her shoes tight, just like her coach taught her.","When Olivia arrived at the tennis courts, the first thing she did was stretch. She wanted to make sure that her body was warmed up and ready to go before starting to play tennis. She stretched her legs first, and then she stretched her arms. Before Olivia started her lesson, her coach would always remind her what skills she needed to work on.","Her coach's reminders helped her to focus on those skills during the lesson. He would often tell her to keep her eye on the ball so that she could hit it right in the middle of the racquet. During the tennis lesson, Olivia's coach practiced drills with her. He would hit the ball to her right or to her left, and she would have to hit the ball back to her coach. Olivia was good at drills, and she liked practicing them so that she could get even better.","Sometimes Olivia's coach would set up targets for her to hit at. This was Olivia's favorite part because she liked the sound the ball made when she hit a target. At the end of the lesson, Olivia always stretched her arms and legs again so that she wouldn't get sore. She was usually pretty thirsty, so she would also drink a lot of water.

He had heard about the towering mountains and the wild animals, and he was excited to see it all for himself. The car ride to Yosemite took many hours, and Marcus spent the whole time reading about the waterfalls and rivers that Yosemite is famous for. Marcus and his family arrived in Yosemite just as the sun was starting to set.","They hurried to unpack their camping supplies from the car before the sun disappeared behind the mountains. Marcus set up the tent while his sister started a campfire in the fire pit. The family sat on logs around the campfire and roasted marshmallows until the fire died out. The next morning, Marcus and his dad woke up at dawn and walked through a nearby meadow. Marcus took photos of deer that were eating grass and shrubs.","His father helped him hold the camera steady so that the photos would look good. After the deer left the meadow, Marcus chased after chipmunks, trying to take pictures of them too. In the afternoon, Marcus's family went to see Yosemite Falls, one of the waterfalls that Marcus had read about. The waterfall was even bigger in real life than Marcus had imagined.","The water coming over the waterfall crashed down on the rocks below and made a loud noise like a rushing river. Marcus knew that he shouldn't get too close to the waterfall because they can be dangerous. Marcus and his family spent a whole week in Yosemite. They admired the natural beauty of the wildlife and breathed in the clean mountain air.

Unrelated tigers have also been observed feeding on prey together. When young female tigers first establish a territory, they tend to do so fairly close to their mother's area. The overlap between the female and her mother's territory tends to decrease over time. Males, however, wander further than females and set out at a younger age to mark out their own area.",He collected pebbles.,He took photos.
5,https://www.beelinereader.com,Nature,No Copyright,"Adult tigers lead solitary lives and congregate only on a temporary basis when special conditions permit, such as plentiful supply of food. They establish and maintain home ranges. Resident adults of either sex tend to confine their movements to a definite territory, within which they satisfy their needs. Those sharing the same ground are well aware of each other's movements and activities.","The size of a tiger's home range mainly depends on the amount of prey, and, in the case of male tigers, on access to females. A tigress may have a territory of 8 square miles, while the territories of males are much larger, covering 30 square miles. The range of a male tends to overlap those of several females.","The relationships between individuals can be quite complex, and apparently tigers follow no set ""rule"" with regards to territorial rights and infringing territories. For instance, although for the most part tigers avoid each other, both male and female tigers have been documented sharing kills, usually with tigers of the opposite sex, or tiger cubs. In contrast to male lions, male tigers will allow the females and cubs to feed on the kill first.","Furthermore, tigers seem to behave relatively amicably when sharing kills, in contrast to lions, which tend to squabble and fight.

She was the second-oldest of seven children. She grew up in the Quaker faith and believed in hard work and a simple life. Her brother Daniel became active in the anti-slavery movement in Kansas, and her sister Mary became a teacher and a women's-rights activist. Anthony remained close to her sisters throughout her life.","Susan was a precocious child, having learned to read and write at age three. In 1826, when Susan was six years old, the Anthony family moved from Massachusetts to Battenville, New York. Susan was sent to attend a local district school, where a teacher refused to teach her long division because of her gender. Upon learning of the weak education she was receiving, her father promptly had her placed in a group home school, where he taught Susan himself.","In 1837, Susan was sent to a Quaker boarding school in Philadelphia. She was not happy there, but she did not have to stay for long. She was forced to end her formal studies because her family, like many others, was financially ruined during the Panic of 1837. In 1839, the family moved to Hardscrabble, New York, in the wake of the panic and economic depression that followed. That same year, Susan left home to teach and pay off her father's debts.","She taught first at Eunice Kenyon's Friends' Seminary, and then at the Canajoharie Academy in 1846, where she rose to become headmistress of the Female Department. Anthony's first occupation inspired her to fight for wages equivalent to those of male teachers, since men earned roughly four times more than women for the same duties.
