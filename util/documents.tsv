This screw-propeller allowed him to conveniently ship goods throughout the midwest of the United States. Soon after, this farmer contracted for a boat to be built that would be powered by steam. Although advised by his builders to substitute the common four-bladed propellers from older versions of boats, he stuck to his original design.	With one propeller at either side of the rudder—called &quot;twin-propellers&quot;—the boat was ready for use. This boat is now known as the Charles Wack. The following season of 1859 was the most active year the Erie Canal has ever known in regard to steam. The Charles Wack was sold to Mr. Prosser, who took out the original propellers, and substituted a modern propeller. This doubled its engine capacity.			The Erie Canal connected Lake Erie to the:	Atlantic Ocean	Hudson River	Mississippi River	Hudson River	The boat, Charles Wack, used ___________ propellers to in its design.	Single	Triple	Twin	Twin

In almost every tree there is at least one trait that marks its individuality and separates it from other trees. It may be the general form of the tree, its mode of branching, bark, bud, or fruit. It may be some variation in color, or, in the case of the evergreen trees, it may be the number and position of the needles or leaves. The pines belong to the coniferous class of trees; that is, trees that bear cones.	The pines may be identified from the other coniferous trees by their leaves, which are in the form of needles two inches or more in length. The pine needles are arranged in clusters. Each species has a certain number of needles to the cluster. This is one of the simplest and most direct ways of distinguishing the different pines. In the white pine there are five needles to each cluster, in the pitch pine there are three, and in the Scotch pine there are two. 			Characters that allow you to identify different types of trees include:	Variation of color and form	The number and position of needles and leaves	Both a and b	Both a and b	One way to identify a pine tree is by noticing how the pine needles are arranged:	Randomly	In groups of exactly 20	In clusters	In clusters

Its volume is more than a million times that of the earth. Its temperature is far higher than any that can be produced on the earth, even in the most efficient electric furnaces. Tools, like high powered telescopes, are used to show that the sun contains many elements, particularly metals. The stars that seem to fill the sky on a clear night are suns. Many of these stars are much larger and more brilliant than our own sun.	They appear to be relatively faint points of light in the sky because of their enormous distances from us. The nearest of them is so remote that it would take more than four years for its light to come to the solar system; and others, still within the range of large telescopes, are a thousand times more distant. There are only about 5000 stars visible to the naked eye, but great photographic telescopes that are now used, show several hundreds of millions of them.			The sun is composed of many elements including:	Sand	Rock	Metal	Metal	Although we can view many stars with the naked eye, it would take nearly _________ years for the nearest star’s light to come into our solar system.	4	20	50	4

As a creative young mind, he took an interest in other composers’ works. He studied Bach’s compositions so much that he was able to play the greater part of the &quot;Well-tempered Clavichord&quot; at twelve years old. As a boy, he was shy and reserved. Instead of playing with children his age, he began learning the art of music composition.	In fact, he is said to have written a cantata at the age of ten. When he was seventeen he went to Vienna, Italy. Here, he met Mozart who was at the height of his fame. On his first meeting with Mozart, Beethoven performed a composition influenced by the great composer. In fact, he played with such an effect and such emotion that when he finished, Mozart made a remark that people should, &quot;Pay attention to him. He will make a noise in the world some day.&quot;			One of the composers who Beethoven admired was:	Bach	Chopin	Haydn	Bach	Beethoven’s first meeting with Mozart was in:	Italy	Austria	Romania	Italy

He believed that the electricity in a Leyden Jar, an antique electrical device consisting of a glass jar and metal foil which could store static electricity, was the same thing as the lightning we see in a thunderstorm. He made a kite out of a silk handkerchief, and fastened a sharp iron point to the upright stick of the kite. One day, when a thunder-storm was coming, Franklin and his son went out to the fields.	The kite was raised; then Franklin tied an iron key to the lower end of the string. After waiting some time, he felt certain that the electricity was coming down the string. He put his knuckle close to the key, and a spark flew out. Next, he took his Leyden Jar and collected the electricity in that. He had made two great discoveries that day: he found out that electricity and lightning are the same thing, and he had also found how to fill his Leyden jar directly from the clouds.			A Leyden jar is:	A jar for storing perishable goods	An electrical device that held electricity	An antique lightbulb	An electrical device that held electricity	Franklin discovered that electricity is:	The same as lightning	A different makeup than lightning	Entirely different than lightning	The same as lightning

Thomas and George Brown - held a meeting to determine the best way to restore trade that had been lost in the Baltimore region. The result was a petition to open &quot;The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company&quot; which would have the right to build and operate a railroad from the city of Baltimore to the Ohio River. The construction of the railroad began on July 4, 1828.	Charles Carroll, the only surviving signer of the Declaration of Independence, was invited to lay the first stone down to signify the start of construction. He said, &quot;I consider this among the most important acts of my life, second only to my signing the Declaration of Independence.&quot; By 1832, the whole line had been opened, making the railroad a total of seventy-two miles in all. By 1842, the railroad had more than 500 miles of track. This construction began a new era of transportation and efficiency for the American people.			Philip E. Thomas and George Brown were in charge of:	Building a canal through Maryland	Pioneering building a railroad from Baltimore to Cleveland, Ohio	Pioneering building a railroad from Baltimore to the Ohio River	Pioneering building a railroad from Baltimore to the Ohio River	Charles Carroll, an honored guest at the groundbreaking for the railroad, was one of the men who signed the:	Constitution	Declaration of Independence	Bill of Rights	Declaration of Independence

The Pueblos’ first necessity of life is the transportation and preservation of water. In an effort to transport water, the people once tried using skins of animals, but this was unsuccessful as the water sitting in animal skins in a hot climate would contaminate it. Later, a more successful water vessel was created. They were tubes of wood or sections of canes.	Although these canes grew in abundance in this area, another, more effective water vessel came into play. Gourds, which also grew in abundance in these places, were better shapes and held a larger volume of water. To help protect and transport the gourd, it was encased in a net of coarse wicker like rope which was made out of yucca leaves or of flexible splints. The use of this wicker with water-vessels points toward the development of the water-tight basketry of the southwest.			The first vessel used to transport water was made out of:	Canvas	Animal skin	Leaves	Animal skin	The development of baskets resulted in the water vessel being:	Unbreakable	Water-tight	Temperature regulated	Water-tight

The Navaho recognize two distinct classes of hogans, winter huts and summer shelters. Winter huts are a staple of Navajo culture. On the outside, they resemble mounds of earth hollowed out. However, they are warm and comfortable. Decoration on the inside or outside of the houses is uncommon, yet, the hogans are usually referred to as &quot;beautiful.&quot;	The rules for building a winter house do not apply to the summer huts. The summer hut is one of the most primitive and simple shelters the Navajo builds. 4 to 5 feet of branches are piled on three sides of a circle 15 or 20 feet in diameter. A fire is built in the center and blankets are thrown over outstanding branches here and there, creating a great amount of shade during the hot summer days. Although it is a makeshift shelter, it is effective to escape from the brutal heat.			Winter huts are described as:	Rough	Beautiful	Earthy	Beautiful	Summer huts are usually:	Permanent homes	Beautiful	Makeshift	Makeshift

The travelers saw the land of hope before them, a wide sweep of rolling country, covered with trees. They were alive with interest and curiosity, because this unknown land was to be their home, but no one was more eager than Henry Ware, a strong, fifteen year old boy. The long journey from their old home in Maryland had been a delight to Henry.	There were no tearful goodbyes as he left. Henry’s entire family came on the journey: his mother, brother and younger sister were in the fourth wagon from the right, and his father stood beside it. As they moved forward, Henry felt like he was coming home, like he had seen this place before. The forests and the mountains were a friendly sight. He seemed to breathe a newer and fresher air than that of Maryland that he left behind, and his mind expanded with the thought of what was to come.

There were a number of boys on the ship, but two of them were my favorites. Jack Martin was a tall, broad-shouldered boy of eighteen, with a handsome, good-humoured face. My other companion was Peterkin Jay. He was little, quick, funny, mischievous, and about fourteen years old. Days dragged on as our friendship grew, and after a while, the days started to blur together.	When we approached Cape Horn, the weather became very cold and stormy, and the sailors began to tell stories about the furious gales and the dangers of that terrible cape. Nevertheless we passed the dreaded cape without much rough weather. At last we came among the Coral Islands of the Pacific; and I shall never forget the delight when I looked upon the pure white, dazzling shores, and the rich green palm-trees. The three of us longed to be on land once again.			The name of the narrator is:	Jack	Petekin	We never learn it	We never learn it	The ship traveled around:	Cape Horn	Cape May	Cape Cod	Cape Horn

He held a battered violin that looked as if it had been used for generations. The young singer was twelve years old, but small for his age. In spite of the dirt, his face was strikingly handsome, especially when he smiled. He was always smiling in spite of hardships, which were many in his life. Phil had been wandering the streets, singing and playing for two hours. However, he had not received a penny.	He was about to change his position when the basement door of one of the houses opened, and a servant came out. &quot;My young master wants to hear you play on your fiddle,&quot; said the servant. &quot;He’s sick, and can’t come out.&quot; Phil followed through the giant house up to the parlor where the sick boy sat. The little fiddler, who had never been invited into a fine house before, looked with admiration at the handsome furniture. He knew that this could be a moment that changed his life.
